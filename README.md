# Simon Says!

Project Simon Says! of the Platzi JavaScript Basics Course

Simon Says! It is the project of the Platzi JavaScript Fundamentals Course.

To achieve this, take the first musical notes (DO, RE, MI, FA), which you download in free .wav format, which does not affect the copyright of other formats such as .mp3.

On the other hand, also add a sound of triumph at the end of the Game, so that when the user finishes the game, this with the idea that a sense of accomplishment at the end.
 
 - Likewise, also add a simple but effective Level counter, so that the user can have
 the perception that he is making progress in the game and that his progress is successful.
 
 I hope that for people who are interested in testing it and verifying the code, it is to their liking, since for me it has
 It was a good challenge, in my process of updating knowledge about WEB Development that I undertook in this year 2019.
 
 
 Greetings and keep on going ..;)
